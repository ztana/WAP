use some time in hide the error message. I tired both hidden="true" nor
hidden="false" are  make it hidden. so I add a string of "hidden" or ""
to the p of error message and make it work.


for the other error message(attempt)
i was trying handle the error message dynamically.
like read a text from other class and add it in.  failed.
But I really want to continue trying.
<script>
                    :root {
                        --test:"test";
                    }
                    document.getElementById("errMeg").innerHTML = var(--test);
</script>

                       min             max             fact            status
